# Presentation

My name is Omar Bonilla Rojas, and this is my technical test for the company **Genuine**. I hope you find it to your liking.

## Documentation

### 1. **Which tools and technologies did you use for the project? Why?**
   
   *In this project I used JavaScript and React, because they are the tools that I use best*

---

### 2. **Which were the main challenges in the process? How did you solve it?**

   *I would say that the main challenge with this test was managing to arrange the information in a clear, concise and attractive way, and I solved it basically with trial and error until I found a design that I liked enough*

---

### 3. **Do you have any suggestion to the design?**

   *I took the decision not to be guided entirely by the design given in figma, and to make some adjustments and so on to make a more personal design, so basically the improvements that I would like to propose I developed at once*

---

### 4. **If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?**

   *The best advice I would give me for a time issue would be to be clear before development about what I will do and how I will do it, dedicate a little more time to design and planning.*

---

### 5. **Did you learn anything new?**

   *I learned more about responsive box design with the challenges of this project.*

---

### 6. **Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?**

   *I would say that it is more of an approximation, because obviously in a challenge in which you have so little time you cannot give freedom to your imagination, but it is a good start to give an entry test to everything I can do.*

---

### 7. **Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?**

   *Knowing how to plan and design websites from scratch, and more attention to details, since I tend to be more incisive with the issue of how it looks and the UX*
